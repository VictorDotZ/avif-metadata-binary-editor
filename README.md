# avif-metadata-binary-editor
It is not the full-fledged editor. This code can only show some image properties and offer to edit the text in "Handler Reference Box": all of these using binary representation of the file. 

## Usage
```bash 
a.out filename.avif --commedit
```

> Don't type --commedit if you only want to see image properties.
